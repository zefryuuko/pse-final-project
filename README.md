# Smart Trash Management System

Pervasive Software Engineering Final Project Repository

## Product Summary
The smart trash management sytem allows the users to receive updates on the amount of content each trash has every time it is added. The user will get a notification on the amount of trash in the trash bin through a graphical user interface web application. With the help of an open-sourced multi-dimensional visualization web application called Grafana, users will be able to view the analytics and statistics of the trash bin through a graph and attractive visualization. This helps ensure that user can manage the efficiency of workload and manpower needed to do trash control.

This may be beneficial for offices, malls, festivals, or even public facilities such as the road, pedestrian walking, train stations, airports, and others. Eradicating the need to send people to do a roll in checking each of the trash container and rather using this efficient system to check for trends and to minimize resources. With these analytics, users can find trash hotspot location, the time of day trash is most often added, and others. Furthermore, the investment needed to implement this system is low. There are only a few IoT devices and a computer.

The IoT devices are:
1. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (Rp 12.000,00)
2. Reed switch (Rp 2.000,00)
3. Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 module (Rp 35.000,00)
4. Battery shield (Rp 20.000,00)
5. 18650 battery + case (Rp 22.000,00)
6. Mini breadboard (Rp 5.000,00)

All those components will be placed in each of the trash containers. The total sum of money needed to create the sensor is Rp 96.000,00. The ultrasonic sensor allows the device to measure the distance from the lid of the trash container to the trash. The reed switch triggers the device to send the distance when a trash is added by disconnecting when the lid is open and reconnecting when the lid is closed. The battery will be used to power the device. The ESP8266 module will be used to connect to the WiFi and acts as the brain of the device. The battery shield allows the batteries to be attached to the ESP8266 module. When the device is in idle, it will go to a deep sleep mode to save energy. Every time trash is added into the trash container, the ID of the trash container, the height of the trash, the max height of the trash container, and the remaining voltage of the battery.
